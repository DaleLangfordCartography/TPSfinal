	<p class="generalText"> Every year, students from Fleming College’s Geographic Information Systems Applications Specialist and Cartographic Specialist

		developing web applications. Students have the opportunity to select projects that align with their interests and gain invaluable practical 
		experience to prepare them for the GIS workforce!</p>
