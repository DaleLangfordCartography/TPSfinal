<!-- GENERAL -->

<div class="block1">
    <h1 class = "title4"> Our Project</h1>
	<p class="generalText">As part of their modernization initiatives, The Toronto Police Service (TPS) has expressed interest in the reinvigoration of 
		their existing public information portal. The current TPS portal offers several individual web maps that communicate crime trends throughout the city 
		but suffers from a lack of integration. The TPS has proposed a new web solution called Know Your Neighbourhood (KYN) which is intended to strengthen 
		a user’s access to information about their community. As a community partner, we have developed a single web solution where users can explore crime 
		information at the neighbourhood level. To accomplish these goals, we gathered and processed data, designed a web layout, designed, and implemented 
		a standardized symbology, developed a web solution, and documented the entire process in the form of a detailed implementation guide. Community 
		engagement and transparency is vital to effective policing, and this web solution will contribute to achieving this goal. </p>

<div class="block1">
    <h1 class = "title4"> Using this Website</h1>
	<p class="generalText"> This website was developed to showcase our work on the Know Your Neighbourhood (KYN) Application. This application, built 
		with ArcGIS Online Configurable Web Apps, is meant to give users meaningful information about crime in Toronto’s neighbourhoods.</p>
		<p class="generalText"> To learn about the KYN project and our methods in developing the application, visit the Projects page. To view the 
			final Web Application, please visit our Solutions page. </p>

<div class="block1">
    <h1 class = "title4"> Collaborative Projects at Fleming College</h1>
	<p class="generalText"> Every year, students from Fleming College’s Geographic Information Systems Applications Specialist and Cartographic Specialist 
		programs venture into a co-operative GIS project involving real work and real clients. These projects integrate the various skills and knowledge 
		gained throughout the first two semesters of study. Project topics have a wide breadth ranging from classification of remotely sensed data to 
		developing web applications. Students have the opportunity to select projects that align with their interests and gain invaluable practical 
		experience to prepare them for the GIS workforce!</p>

<div class="block1">
    <h1 class = "title4"> Past TPS Collaborative Projects</h1>
	<p class="generalText"> The Toronto Police Service (TPS) has partnered with Fleming College for the 2021 Collaborative Project Program detailing 
		their project specifications and expected outcomes. However, this is not the first time the TPS has partnered with Fleming College in this 
		program. In 2020, Fleming students developed a geocoder in their project titled

		Transforming Location Descriptions To Spatial Data: Developing A Customized Canada-Wide Composite Locator</a> and serves as an excellent 
		example of the high quality in what Fleming students produce for their clients. Our project is very different in nature, but all the same, 
		our team is dedicated to producing high quality products that will be used and make a difference.</p>
