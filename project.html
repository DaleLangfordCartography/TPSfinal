<!-- GENERAL -->

<div class="block1">
    <h1 class="title4">Making Changes for a Better Future</h1>
	<div>
		<p class="generalText">The Toronto Police Service currently provides a large amount of data through a public web portal. 
			Unfortunately, it is scattered across several web maps and dashboards and is hard to consume. The average person would 
			find it hard to understand what is happening in their own neighbourhood. We wanted to fix that.
		</p>

	</div>
</div>

<div class="block1">
    <h1 class="title4">How Can We Help?</h1>
	<div>
		<p class="generalText">We wanted to build an easy-to-use web application that allowed people to understand crime in their 
			neighbourhood. People should be able to tell what types of crime occur in their neighbourhood, whether crime is 
			increasing or decreasing, and how they compare to the rest of the city.
		</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="block1">
    <h1 class="title4">Prepping the Data: </h1>
	<p class = homeSubHead> FME and Data Pre-processing</p>
	<div>
		<img class="projectimage3" alt="Screen capture of ETL process in FME" src="images/ETL.JPG" width="700" height="371">
		<p class="generalText">All of the data used in this project are from public sources. Using FME to connect directly to 
			REST services and a file geodatabase, several distinct datasets were transformed and combined into a single occurrence 
			layer. This consisted of all major crimes which occurred in Toronto between 2014 and 2020. This layer was then loaded 
			to the Fleming College AGOL Organization as a hosted feature layer. This was the environment where the KYN Application 
			was built. 
		</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="block1">
    <h1 class="title4">Custom Point Symbology</h1>
	<div>
		<img class="projectimage3" alt="Results of custom symbology creation" src="images/Symbology.png" width="700" height="329">
		<p class="generalText">Custom point symbology was created for all crime types that were used in the KYN application. We 
			initially created a series of sketches during a brain-storming session (some stranger than others) and worked as a 
			team to select those that we felt were the best fit for our application. These were then refined over the course of 
			the project through consultation with the TPS. Colour was then applied that ensured we met the Web Content Accessibility Guideline (WCAG) standard for 
			non-text contrast against our application basemap.  
		</p>
	</div>

<div class="block1">
    <h1 class="title4">Bringing it all Together</h1>
	<p class = homeSubHead>Web Maps</p>
	<div>
		<img class="projectimage3" alt="Image of pop-up windows created using Arcade Expressions" src="images/Arcade_PopUp.png" width="700px" height="432px">
		<p class = "projectimagesubtext">Here you can see the final look of the Web Map pop-up windows providing summary data for Toronto neighbourhoods</p>
		<p class="generalText">Using AGOL Web Maps, we implemented our customized symbology and incorporated custom arcade statements. Arcade, ESRI’s in-house 
			programming language, allows us to perform dynamic operations in the web environment. We used Arcade to make dynamic text, URLs, graphs and charts. 
		</p>
	</div>

	<p class = homeSubHead>Dashboards</p>
	<div>
		<img class="projectimage3" alt="Finished Dashboards landing page in desktop and mobile" src="images/LandingPage_Methods.PNG" width="700px" height="332px">
		<p class = "projectimagesubtext">Final Dashboard configuration of the KYN landing page in desktop and mobile</p>
		<p class="generalText">To make the landing page of our application as simple and intuitive as possible, our team decided on the use of ESRI’s Dashboard application. 
			A total of 6 Dashboards were created for this application, with 3 being configured for desktop and 3 configured for mobile devices. The dashboards were configured 
			using the drag-and-drop customization – an ideal development option for creating rapid prototypes and updating configurations quickly to meet changes in need.
		</p>

		<p class="generalText">Users can explore the map by panning or zooming, searching an address, or by selecting their neighbourhood from a dropdown list. To provide 
			the user with crime data for their neighbourhood, indicator and chart widgets (pre-developed tools) were added. These widgets automatically update to show the user how crime has changed 
			in the area that they are viewing. To provide additional at-a-glance information, the Indicator widget was formatted using Arcade expressions to highlight whether 
			crime had increased, decreased, or stayed the same between 2019 and 2020. 
		</p>

	</div>

	<p class = homeSubHead>Experience Builder</p>
	<div>
		<img class="projectimage3" alt="Finished Analytics page in desktop and mobile" src="images/Analytics_Methods.PNG" width="700px" height="333px">
		<p class = "projectimagesubtext">Figure 1: Toronto Police Service Logo.</p>
		<p class="generalText">Esri's Experience Builder provides numerous widgets that can be custom configured
			to suit the purposes of the application being developed. One of its greatest strengths is
			the ability to integrate multiple applications into a single environment which was valuable
			for building our all-inclusive solution.			
		</p>

		<p class="generalText">Our Experience Builder application was developed via drag and drop widgets that were custom
			configured to suit the purposes of the KYN Application. We also incorporated adaptive design
			so that it would be accessible to users of all device types.

<div class="block1">
    <h1 class="title4">A little something extra</h1>
	<p class = homeSubHead>Spatial stats and infographic</p>
	<div>
		<p class="generalText">We were interested in exploring the effects that the pandemic had on crime within Toronto 
			and conducted a total of seven spatial/statistical analyses to quantify differences related
			to the magnitude, where, and when occurrences were taking place. We use a combination of
			data visualization techniques to synthesize our results into a comprehensive infographic.
