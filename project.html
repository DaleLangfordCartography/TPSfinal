		<p class="generalText">The Toronto Police Service (TPS) was established in 1834 (the first local policing service of the continent!) and has been providing law enforcement 
			services ever since following their core values: Service at the Core, Do the Right Thing, Connect with Compassion, Reflect and Grow. There are many working parts within 
			the TPS, but this partiuclar project is being led by Tyler Munn and Debbie Verduga who occupy the roles of Senior GIS & and Data Intergration Specialist and Senior Crime 
			Analyst respectively.

	<p class = "projectimagesubtext">Figure 2: Toronto Police Service Public Safety Data Portal Maps.</p>
	<div>
		<p class="generalText">The Toronto Police Service (TPS) recognized in their 2017 review Action Plan: The Way Forward that current policing strategies require revision to better 
			serve communities. A component of this initiative is to update to how policing data are consumed by the TPS and presented to the public.
		</p>
		<p class="generalText">The emphasis on both providing open data and shifting to community-centric policing has led the TPS to the decision to develop a web solution called 
			Know Your Neighbourhood (KYN), which is intended to be a one-stop-shop for public safety data. The current TPS data portal is spread across several web map applications
			 and has a city-wide focus. This results in an end-user experience that is negatively impacted by the presentation of relevant public safety data in separate places.

	<p class = homeSubHead>How Can We Help?</p>
	<div>
		<p class="generalText">As a community partner of this project, Team EDGE will be assisting the TPS in developing the solution. In developing a solution, our primary objectives are:
		</p>
		<p>1. Create a web map solution to display open crime data to the public, as well as additional functionality for skilled users to customize how they interact with the data.</p>
		<p>2. Develop tools that will allow public users to view summarized statistics for neighborhood and police divisions within the city of Toronto. </p>
		<p>3. Develop a set of design standards, including symbology and cartographic conventions, while adhering to AODA guidelines.</p>
		<p>4. Create a user guide (for internal use) so that the TPS can reproduce our implementation as new needs arise. </p>
