    <h1 class="title4">The Problem</h1>
	<p class = homeSubHead>Making Changes for a Better Future</p>
	<div>
		<p class="generalText">The Toronto Police Service (TPS) recognized in their 2017 review Action Plan: The Way Forward that current policing strategies require revision to better 
			serve communities. A component of this initiative is to update to how policing data are consumed by the TPS and presented to the public.
		</p>
		<p class="generalText">The emphasis on both providing open data and shifting to community-centric policing has led the TPS to the decision to develop a web solution called 
			Know Your Neighbourhood (KYN), which is intended to be a one-stop-shop for public safety data. The current TPS data portal is spread across several web map applications
			 and has a city-wide focus. This results in an end-user experience that is negatively impacted by the presentation of relevant public safety data in separate places.

	<p class = homeSubHead>How Can We Help?</p>
	<div>
		<p class="generalText">As a community partner of this project, Team EDGE will be assisting the TPS in developing the solution. In developing a solution, our primary objectives are:
		</p>
		<p>1. Create a web map solution to display open crime data to the public, as well as additional functionality for skilled users to customize how they interact with the data.</p>
		<p>2. Develop tools that will allow public users to view summarized statistics for neighborhood and police divisions within the city of Toronto. </p>
		<p>3. Develop a set of design standards, including symbology and cartographic conventions, while adhering to AODA guidelines.</p>
		<p>4. Create a user guide (for internal use) so that the TPS can reproduce our implementation as new needs arise. </p>
