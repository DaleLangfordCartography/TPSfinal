    <h1 class="title4">The Problem</h1>
	<p class = homeSubHead>Making Changes for a Better Future</p>
	<div>
		<p class="generalText">The Toronto Police Service currently provides a large amount of data through a public web portal. 
			Unfortunately, it is scattered across several web maps and dashboards and is hard to consume. The average person would 
			find it hard to understand what is happening in their own neighbourhood. We wanted to fix that.
		</p>

<div class="block1">
    <h1 class="title4">Project Scope</h1>
	<p class = homeSubHead>How Can We Help?</p>
	<div>
		<p class="generalText">We wanted to build an easy-to-use web application that allowed people to understand crime in their 
			neighbourhood. People should be able to tell what types of crime occur in their neighbourhood, whether crime is 
			increasing or decreasing, and how they compare to the rest of the city.
		</p>
	</div>
</div>

<div class="block1">
    <h1 class="title4">Prepping the Data</h1>
	<p class = homeSubHead>FME Section</p>
	<div>
		<img class="projectimage3" alt="Screen capture of ETL process in FME" src="images/ETL.JPG" width="700" height="371">
		<p class="generalText">All of the data used in this project are from public sources. Using FME to connect directly to 
			REST services and a file geodatabase, several distinct datasets were transformed and combined into a single occurrence 
			layer. This consisted of all major crimes which occurred in Toronto between 2014 and 2020. This layer was then loaded 
			to the Fleming College AGOL Organization as a hosted feature layer. This was the environment where the KYN Application 
			was built.

		<img class="projectimage3" alt="Results of custom symbology creation" src="images/Symbology.png" width="700" height="329">
		<p class="generalText">Custom point symbology was created for all crime types that were used in the KYN application. We 
			initially created a series of sketches during a brain-storming session (some stranger than others) and worked as a 
			team to select those that we felt were the best fit for our application. These were then refined over the course of 
			the project through consultation with the TPS. Colour was then applied that ensured we met the Web Content Accessibility Guideline (WCAG) standard for 
			non-text contrast against our application basemap.
