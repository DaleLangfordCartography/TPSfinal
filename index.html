    <h1 class = "title4"> The Collaborative Project</h1>
	<p class="generalText"> Every year, students at Fleming College’s Geographic Information Systems Applications Specialist and Cartographic Specialist 
		programs venture into a co-operative GIS project involving real work and real clients. These projects integrate the various skills and knowledge 
		gained throughout the first two semesters of study. Project topics have a wide breadth ranging from classification of remotely sensed data to 
		developing web applications. Students have the opportunity to select projects that align with their interests and gain invaluable practical 
		experience to prepare them for the GIS workforce!</p>

<div class="block1">
    <h1 class = "title4"> Our Project</h1>
	<p class="generalText"> The Toronto Police Service (TPS) has partnered with Fleming College for the 2021 Collaborative Project Program detailing 
		their project specifications and expected outcomes. However, this is not the first time the TPS has partnered with Fleming College in this 
		program. In 2020, Fleming students developed a geocoder in their project titled 
		<a href="https://ssfcollege-my.sharepoint.com/personal/shawnm_flemingcollege_ca/Documents/Microsoft%20Teams%20Chat%20Files/2009_FinalReport_bcolgan_mvanmeer.pdf">
		Transforming Location Descriptions To Spatial Data: Developing A Customized Canada-Wide Composite Locator</a> and serves as an excellent 
		example of the high quality that Fleming students produce for their clients. Our project is very different in nature, but all the same, 
		our team is dedicated to producing high quality products that will be used and make a difference.</p>
