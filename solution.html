	<div>
		<p class="generalText">The landing page of the KYN application was designed to be simple and intuitive. This 
			design philosophy stems from the objective of making an application that is accesible for people who are 
			not as adept at using technology. By using ESRI Dashboards we were able to build a solution that would allow 
			users to engage with crime data by clicking, paning, and scrolling to an area of interest. While the user 
			navigates, the widgets on the left-hand side of the map will provide and update of the total crimes within 
			the viewable map extent - no filtering or searching required! Should the user wish to look for a particular 
			neighbourhood or area, they can either select it from the drop-down menu provided or enter their address 
			into the map search bar. Additionally, the Major Crime Indicators (MCI) map allows the user a little more 
			control by providing the option to show only the MCI they are interested in.

		<p class="generalText">The Analysis page of our application was designed to expand on the capabilities of the landing
			page allowing for greater control over the specific data the user wants to explore. For each
			data set, the user can apply a combination of filters, execute a spatial query by drawing
			custom shapes, and then view a series of charts summarizing the queried data. If the user
			would like to do more with the queried data, our application also supports data exporting in
			CSV, JSON, and GeoJSON.

		<p class="generalText">A fun product of the KYN collaborative project was the creation of a static infographic to 
			explore how neighborhood crime in the City of Toronto changed because of the 2020 pandemic lockdown. Comparing 
			the period of March 17 to December 31 for 2019 (pre-pandemic) and 2020 (pandemic) we found an overall decrease 
			in neighbourhood MCI crime except for automotive theft, which increased over this time. Other trends investigated 
			were where crime was happening and at what time.

		<p class="generalText">The final infographic can be explored by following the link located in the MCI Dashboard side 
			panel, or by following our link provided <a class="link" target=" " href = "https://fleming-tps-kykapp.github.io/Collab/Infographic/CovidCrime_Infographic_Final.png">HERE</a>.
