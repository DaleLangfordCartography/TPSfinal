		<p class="generalText">The landing page of the KYN application was designed to be simple and intuitive. This 
			design philosophy stems from the objective of making an application that is accesible for people who are 
			not as adept at using technology. By using ESRI Dashboards we were able to configure a map that would allow 
			users to engage with crime data by clicking, paning, and scrolling to an area of interest. While the user 
			navigates, the widgets on the left-hand side of the map will provide and update of the total crimes within 
			the viewable map extent - no filtering or searching required! Should the user wish to look for a particular 
			neighbourhood or area, they can either select it from the drop-down menu provided or enter their address 
			into the map search bar. Additionally, the Major Crime Indicators (MCI) map allows the user a little more 
			control by providing the option to show only the MCI they are interested in.
